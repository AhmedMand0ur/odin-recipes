        <h2>How to Make Fried Shrimp</h2>
        <p>Restaurant-worthy fried shrimp is 15 minutes (and a few simple ingredients) away. Take it from us: This irresistibly crunchy fried shrimp recipe is impossible to beat.</p>
        <h3>Fried Shrimp Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour: </strong> your shrimp in all-purpose flour before frying promotes a wonderfully crunchy crust.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>Dipping the floured shrimp in eggs gives the bread crumbs something to adhere to.</li>
            <li><strong>Bread Crumbs: </strong>Panko bread crumbs add the perfect amount of flavor and crunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Shrimp: </strong>You'll need one pound of peeled, deveined jumbo shrimp.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil: </strong>Vegetable oil is great for frying, as it has a neutral flavor and can stand up to high heat.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Fry Shrimp</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong> Set up your workspace: </strong>Mix the flour and seasonings in one bowl. Beat the eggs until frothy in a second bowl. Place the bread crumbs in a third bowl.</li>
            <li><strong> Dredge, dip, and coat: </strong>Dredge the shrimp in the flour mixture, then dip it into the eggs. Finally, press the shrimp in the crumbs. Turn to coat.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the shrimp: </strong> oil in a heavy pot to 350 degrees F. Deep fry the shrimp in batches until cooked through. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</li>
